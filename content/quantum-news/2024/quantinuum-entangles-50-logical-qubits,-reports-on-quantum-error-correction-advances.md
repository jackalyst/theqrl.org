Quantinuum has set a new industry benchmark by demonstrating 50 entangled logical qubits with fidelities exceeding 98%, marking significant progress toward scalable quantum computing systems. This achievement was highlighted during their presentation at the Q2B conference, where they also showcased advances in quantum error correction (QEC), including single-shot techniques that enhance fault tolerance and speed up computational processes. 

The company's Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture plays a pivotal role in these advancements, offering all-to-all qubit connectivity, mid-circuit measurement, and feed-forward capabilities, which are essential for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.
