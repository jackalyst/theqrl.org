At ETHDenver 2025 weâ€™re thrilled to announce Project Zond Preview, our latest advancement in quantum-secure blockchain technology. Project Zond delivers exceptional improvements across multiple dimensions, enabling two major breakthroughs.

- **Post-Quantum Security:** Project Zond effectively protects your blockchain applications from the imminent threat of quantum attacks. This addresses a critical challenge in ensuring the long-term security of decentralized systems.
- **Seamless Ethereum Integration:** Leveraging the Zond Virtual Machine (ZVM), Project Zond is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows developers to continue using their favorite tools while enhancing their smart contracts with quantum-resistant security.

> **Note:** Currently you'll find our documentation references our Project Zond Beta-Testnet which has been running solidly for a year and is a testament to our commitment to enterprise grade applications! We'll be pushing out an update that covers Project Zond's Testnet Preview in the coming days.
