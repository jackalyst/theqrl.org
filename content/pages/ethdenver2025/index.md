## Overview

At ETHDenver 2025 we’re thrilled to announce the Project Zond BUIDL Testnet Preview, our latest advancement in quantum-secure blockchain technology. Project Zond delivers exceptional improvements across multiple dimensions, enabling two major breakthroughs.

- **Post-Quantum Security:** Project Zond effectively protects your blockchain applications from the imminent threat of quantum attacks. This addresses a critical challenge in ensuring the long-term security of decentralized systems.
- **Ethereum Integration:** Leveraging the Zond Virtual Machine (ZVM), Project Zond is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows developers to continue using their favorite tools while enhancing their smart contracts with quantum-resistant security.

## Come find us

Join the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) core team in the Privacyville (next to the Coffee Lounge!) to explore Project Zond — a groundbreaking leap in quantum-resistant blockchain technology.
