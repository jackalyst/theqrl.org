The rise of quantum computing isn’t science fiction — it’s a ticking clock for blockchain security. With breakthroughs like [Google’s Willow](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/) and [Microsoft's Majorana 1](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/) pushing quantum capabilities forward, cryptographic systems underpinning today’s blockchains are at risk. The U.S. government has already sounded the alarm, mandating cryptographic upgrades by 2030. Financial institutions are already adapting. But what about Web3?

## Introducing Project Zond

In response to these challenges, at [ETHDenver 2025](https://www.ethdenver.com/), we’ll be showcasing Project Zond, a next-generation evolution in quantum-secure blockchain technology. 

Built on Ethereum’s foundation, it introduces a Zond Virtual Machine (ZVM) (similar to Hyperion) with an address space that's post-quantum secure using Dilithium. This means developers can keep using their favorite tools — but with a critical upgrade: quantum-resistant security.

No need to reinvent the wheel; just build with confidence.

- Post-Quantum Security: Protect your applications from the looming threat of quantum attacks.
- EVM Compatibility: Seamlessly integrate with existing Ethereum tools and infrastructure.
- Web3-Ready: Build the next generation of decentralized applications with confidence.
- Developer-Friendly: Use your existing skills and favorite tools to create quantum-safe solutions.

Developers will be able to run a full Private Zond Testnet Preview network locally on their machine. This is the network that will materialize as successor of our Project Zond beta-testnet network, which has been running for over a year! 

## Come See us at ETHDenver! 

**Why ETHDenver anyway?** As the world's largest and longest-running Ethereum hackathon and conference, is the perfect place to dive deep into the future of Web3. It's where innovation happens, where developers connect, and where the next big things are unveiled. And for us, it's the ideal stage to highlight Project Zond's private testnet preview.

### Booth 419

Join the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) core team in the Privacy Pavilion (next to the Coffee Lounge!) to explore Project Zond — a groundbreaking leap in quantum-resistant blockchain technology.

Why stop by?

- **See Project Zond in Action:** Experience our post-quantum secure testnet, designed to protect blockchain ecosystems from tomorrow’s threats today.
- **Hands-On Learning:** Bring your laptop to interact directly with the the testnet preview right from your own laptop — our team will guide you through setup, development, and innovation on our platform.
- **Connect Over Coffee:** Grab your favorite drink and dive into discussions with our experts. Learn why quantum resistance isn’t just optional—it’s essential for blockchain’s survival.

We’re here to answer your questions, collaborate on ideas, and empower developers to build securely in the quantum era.

### Captain Ethereum Stage - February 26th at 3:55pm

Join us to hear Michael Strike, our Director of Outreach, [explain how to build a quantum computer-resistant blockchain](https://www.ethdenver.com/sessions/rechOwVT5LNVuSSGe). He'll discuss the challenges of migrating existing blockchains to post-quantum security and why starting with a quantum-secure foundation from block zero, like QRL offers, is crucial in the face of evolving quantum computing threats. Listen to learn more about the risks and the solution!
