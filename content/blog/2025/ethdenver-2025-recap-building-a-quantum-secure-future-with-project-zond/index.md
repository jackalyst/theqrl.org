ETHDenver, the world's largest annual Web3 event, lived up to the hype. This year's event brought together a strong mix of builders, developers, industry leaders, institutional reps, and crypto enthusiasts from around the globe. Our QRL team was thrilled to participate on the main show floor, showcasing our latest advancements in quantum-secure blockchain technology in Project Zond.

## Quantum Security Takes Center Stage

Throughout ETHDenver, our team engaged in countless high-quality discussions about the imminent quantum computing threat and how it impacts blockchain security. Developers, retail investors, institutions, and representatives from a few of the world's largest banks were especially interested in what we’re building. As the only provably post-quantum secure blockchain project in the space, running since 2018 with NIST-standardized cryptography, QRL stands uniquely positioned to safeguard blockchain applications from quantum vulnerabilities.

[Michael Strike](https://www.theqrl.org/team/michaels/) delivered a compelling presentation on the Captain Ethereum stage titled "How to Build a Quantum Computer Resistant Blockchain With QRL." His talk attracted additional interest in the following days at the event, underscoring the growing awareness of the quantum threat within the Ethereum (and broader blockchain) communities.

Fueled further by recent quantum computing announcements by [Google (Willow)](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/), [Microsoft (Majorana)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2025/02/19/microsoft-unveils-majorana-1-the-worlds-first-quantum-processor-powered-by-topological-qubits/), and [Amazon (Ocelot)](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/quantum-computing-aws-ocelot-chip), more people in the ecosystem are taking notice of the looming quantum threat.

## Project Zond: Seamless Ethereum Integration with Quantum Protection

At ETHDenver 2025, we were proud to unveil the Project Zond BUIDL Testnet Preview. Project Zond represents a significant leap forward, delivering two major breakthroughs:

- **Post-Quantum Security:** Project Zond ensures your blockchain applications remain secure against quantum computing threats, addressing a critical challenge in decentralized systems.
- **Ethereum Compatibility:** Utilizing the Zond Virtual Machine (ZVM), Project Zond allows developers integrates with projects that are built using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) due to its similarity. This compatibility enables developers to continue using familiar Ethereum tools while upgrading their smart contracts to be quantum-resistant without changing their coding habits.

> “The caliber of conversations we had all week at ETHDenver was higher than expected. Whether we were talking to a seasoned blockchain developer or someone from a more traditional banking sector, many were already familiar with the quantum threat (which was refreshing). Our conversations naturally led to them asking, what can we do about it? With Project Zond specific to building, Ethereum developers now have a way to build secure and quantum-resistant applications without needing to change the way they code!”
