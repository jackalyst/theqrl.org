## Day 8: Bring a Brain to the Chain

{{< image "./images/day8.png" >}}

Welcome to Day 8 of the 12 Days of Zond! Today‚Äôs festive theme is a call to action for the community to invite your smartest dev friends to join our post-quantum party: Bring a Brain to the Chain! üß† ‚õè

### What Is It?

Who is one (or a few) of the smartest developers, coders, or tech-savvy friends you know that love to build, explore, and innovate? But they haven‚Äôt yet been introduced to the project ü§Ø

Today‚Äôs event is all about inviting them into Zond early as we shape the future of quantum-resistant blockchain technology‚Ä¶

This is your chance to share Zond‚Äôs vision with talented developers (you know) who you believe can contribute, learn, and grow with the project. They‚Äôre joining a community that‚Äôs leading the charge into the post-quantum era.

### How to Participate

1. Think of Your Smartest Developer Friend(s)
   - It could be a current or past colleague, a friend, or someone else you know and admire online for their coding skills, problem-solving, or curiosity about blockchain and cryptography.
2. Send Them an Invitation
   - Invite them to join Zond and our [QRL Discord](/discord) community. Can be a quick message like the one below or write whatever you want based on how well you know them.
     Here‚Äôs a quick example:
     
     ‚ÄúHey Satoshi! I know you‚Äôre always looking for exciting projects to build on and I know your bar is high- I think QRL‚Äôs Project Zond fits your criteria. They‚Äôve been actively running since 2018 (QRL) and are the leading post-quantum secure blockchain in the space. Project Zond is currently in Testnet as they move from PoW over to PoS. I think you‚Äôll enjoy the online Discord community too and would find it worthwhile to build and explore early during testnet. This project is going to be big. Check it out: QRL Discord #12DaysOfZond‚Äù
3. Celebrate the Brainpower
     - Feel free to give a shoutout in #general-qrl channel when your friend joins so we know you recommended them!

### Why Participate?

- üîç **Grow the Community:** Help bring more smart and like-minded developers into the community
- üõ†Ô∏è **Bolster the Ecosystem:** More builders mean more innovation, tools, and projects on Zond.

### Rewards

We‚Äôll be sharing some holiday prizes with those who legitimately introduce a technical friend to our community.

To ensure we see who you‚Äôve recommended someone, you can DM @jackalyst on the team either on Discord/Telegram. 

***Bonus points if you note their experience broadly (ex: Hey team- I just introduced my friend and they just joined QRL‚Äôs Discord. I‚Äôve known her for a while online- she‚Äôs an experienced Solidity developer)

## Day 7: Post-Quantum Holiday Reading List

   - Share a book, podcast, YouTube video, or article you've enjoyed that touches on:
       - quantum threat
       - post-quantum cryptography.
       - quantum computing's impact on ___
2. Drop your Answers in the Google Form below
   - Head to the google form below and share your resource(s) with us. 
       - [Post-Quantum Holiday Reading List Submission](https://forms.gle/i8KxN2xkEPvunQLX6)

### How to Participate

**Step 1: Head to Discord**

- Go to the **#general-qrl** channel within our Discord community.

Take a moment to think about a fellow community member who deserves recognition. Consider someone who:

- Regularly brings unique value or insights to the chat.
- Welcomes newcomers in a refreshing way.
- Or anyone else who's made a positive impact!

**Step 3: Post Your Compliment**

- Publicly share your compliment in the #general-qrl channel with the following 3 pieces of info:

- The most thoughtful compliments will be dually rewarded with a little bit of quanta (distribution depending on how many participate)

**Example Post**

To help inspire you, here's a quality example:

- @JohnSmith I'm tipping my PQ digital hat to you. Since I've joined the community a few years ago, you've always made me feel welcome and less intimidated. Your help breaking down the technical specifics of the quantum threat into layman terms alongside the team's QRL video content made me realize there are many others like me in the community. Keep doing your thing! #12DaysOfZond

**Not Yet a Community Member?**

This activity is geared toward current community members, but if you're not yet part of the QRL family, join us in our [QRL Discord](/discord).

## Day 1: Post-Quantum Crossword Puzzle Festivity

> **Hint:** Still stuck on #5 across "I Lov this word"? Might be time to use a quantum search algorithm or ask the person who devised it. 
> **Hint 2:** For those on #2 across "suite of algorithms". This suite is for algebraic lattices.

{{< image "./images/day1.png" >}}

Welcome to the first day of the **12 Days of Zond**! We're kicking off the celebration with an activity that's as fun as it is brainy: the **Post-Quantum Crossword Puzzle Competition**. ü•®üîê  

### What Is It?

### How to Participate  

**1. Take a look at the Crossword Puzzle** 

https://crosswordlabs.com/embed/post-quantum-crossword-puzzle-competition

**2. Solve It**  

Fill in the crossword by answering clues related to post-quantum cryptography, quantum computing, and a couple that are specific to Zond.  

**3. Submit Your Crossword Puzzle** 

Once your crossword puzzle is completed correctly, submit your answers by:  

1. Take a quick screenshot of your completed crossword
2. Gather your screenshot 
     - For a bonus you can share this event on social media as well and include a link to it in your message to us.

> Note: The post-quantum crossword festivity is open to every day of the 12 days of Zond
>
> This fits our [standard reward distribution](#standard-reward-distribution) where early participants get more QRL than ones that arrive later.

## Guidelines and additional information

### Create a QRL Address

Creating a QRL address is simple.

1. Download a Wallet: Visit our [downloads](/downloads) page and choose the wallet that suits you best.
2. Create Your Wallet: Follow the instructions within the wallet application to set up your new wallet. 
3. Find Your QRL Address: Once your wallet is created, your QRL address will be displayed. It will always start with a "Q".

**Important Security Tip:**  Always back up your hexseed (a unique string of characters) or mnemonic phrase (a list of words). This ensures you can recover your wallet if something happens to your device. 

> Note: For the mobile wallet, there is a community lead wallet by [Volt Development](https://volt-development.com/) available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.volt.qrlmobile) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/qrl-mobile/id6448219494) that has been preferable to many.
