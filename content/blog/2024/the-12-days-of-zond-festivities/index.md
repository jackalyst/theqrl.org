{{< image "./images/day4.png" >}}

Welcome to **Day 4 of the 12 Days of Zond!** Today’s festivity is all about taking a trip down memory lane.

Depending on how long you’ve been in the community, that trip back to you joining may go back 6 years or maybe only 6 days if you’re brand new here…regardless, you reading this at this very moment in time makes you apart of an elite group of forward thinkers on the web (who are post-quantum secure). That’s a big deal…

Let’s get into today’s activity!

### What Is It?

Whatever your platform of choice is on the internet, tell us about your introduction to the project. You can do so 100% anonymously (through a Google Form) or you can write it out on [Discord](/discord), [Reddit](/reddit), [Telegram](/telegram), or [X/Twitter](/twitter).

Were you up late one night going down an internet rabbit hole when you came across the QRL Whitepaper or did a friend introduce you and you’ve been glued to the laptop since? There’s so many stories that cover how each of us came to this project initially and we’d love to hear your story 💛

### How to Participate

**Step 1: Write out your introduction to the project** 

On [Discord](/discord), [Reddit](/reddit), [Telegram](/telegram), or [X/Twitter](/twitter), write out your introduction to the project and be sure to include [#12DaysOfZond](https://x.com/hashtag/12DaysOfZond). If you'd like to stay anonymous we've also created a [Google Form](https://forms.gle/1CdhUZU5tgF5QgAJ9).

**Step 2: Post/Submit** 

Depending on the number of submissions, we’ll try our best to distribute rewards for each thoughtful response.

### What Is It?

A little holiday treat. We’ve dropped a couple private keys with small prizes in the image below.

**Step 2: Add the Mnemonic Phrases in using the image above as reference**

Once you’ve typed out the mnemonic phrases, you’ll see if there’s anything left in the presents.

If there’s any funds in the public wallet, move them over to a personal wallet as soon as possible (ASAP) to keep it

If someone beats you to it and you’re left with the wrapping paper and the box, no worries… there’s still 9 days left of 12 Days of Zond.

## Day 2: Compliment a community member!

{{< image "./images/day2.png" >}}

Welcome to Day 2 of the 12 Days of Zond! Today’s festivity is all about appreciating and celebrating the amazing members of the [QRL community](/discord). It’s a chance to recognize the unique values and contributions that make our community so special. 👏🎁

### What Is It?

Today’s activity is Discord-specific and revolves around showing appreciation for fellow members of the QRL community. Whether it’s their insightful comments, warm welcomes to newcomers, or consistent contributions, let’s tip our hats to the individuals who make our community thrive.

### How to Participate

**Step 1: Head to Discord**

- Go to the **#general-qrl** channel within our Discord community.

**Step 2: Think About Your Compliment**

Take a moment to think about a fellow community member who deserves recognition. Consider someone who:

- Regularly brings unique value or insights to the chat.
- Welcomes newcomers in a refreshing way.
- Or anyone else who’s made a positive impact!

**Step 3: Post Your Compliment**

- Publicly share your compliment in the #general-qrl channel with the following 3 pieces of info:
- @Mention the user (e.g., @JohnSmith).
- Write out your compliment (what they’ve done and why you appreciate them).

**Include the hashtag #12DaysOfZond**

- The most thoughtful compliments will be dually rewarded with a little bit of quanta (distribution depending on how many participate)

**Example Post**

To help inspire you, here’s a quality example:

- @JohnSmith I’m tipping my PQ digital hat to you. Since I’ve joined the community a few years ago, you’ve always made me feel welcome and less intimidated. Your help breaking down the technical specifics of the quantum threat into layman terms alongside the team’s QRL video content made me realize there are many others like me in the community. Keep doing your thing! #12DaysOfZond

**Not Yet a Community Member?**

This activity is geared toward current community members, but if you’re not yet part of the QRL family, join us in our [QRL Discord](/discord).

By joining, you’ll become part of a vibrant and diverse group of like-minded individuals — from PhDs and academics to retail investors and hardcore cryptographers. It’s a community like no other!

## Day 1: Post-Quantum Crossword Puzzle Festivity

> **Hint:** Still stuck on #5 across "I Lov this word"? Might be time to use a quantum search algorithm or ask the person who devised it. 
> **Hint 2:** For those on #2 across "suite of algorithms". This suite is for algebraic lattices.

## Guidelines and additional information

### Create a QRL Address

Creating a QRL address is simple.

1. Download a Wallet: Visit our [downloads](/downloads) page and choose the wallet that suits you best.
2. Create Your Wallet: Follow the instructions within the wallet application to set up your new wallet. 
3. Find Your QRL Address: Once your wallet is created, your QRL address will be displayed. It will always start with a "Q".

**Important Security Tip:**  Always back up your hexseed (a unique string of characters) or mnemonic phrase (a list of words). This ensures you can recover your wallet if something happens to your device. 

> Note: For the mobile wallet, there is a community lead wallet by [Volt Development](https://volt-development.com/) available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.volt.qrlmobile) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/qrl-mobile/id6448219494) that has been preferable to many.
